AcroBot(servers, nick, chan)

# TODO
#
#     Add '!stop' command
#     Only chanops should be allowed to use '!shutdown'
#     Make help system a bit more elegant
#     Clean up the colours and formatting
#

# Long term goals
#
#     Fully functional AI chatbot with games (including acro) ;)
#     SSL connection support
#     Rewrite the whole damn thing in C and asm
#

# Changelog:
#
# 0.6.1b
#
#     * Bot now autoidentifies to NickServ
#
# 0.6b
#
#     * Implemented built-in help system
#     * Quite alot of fixed bugs, so it's finally time to switch to a higher
#       minor version number. It is still beta though, and most of the
#       bugfixes haven't even been tested yet.
#
# 0.5.9b-r2
#
#     * Bot now recognizes when someone tries to enter more than one acro,
#       gives them a warning and ignores the subsequent acro.
#
# 0.5.9b-r1
#
#     * Hopefully fixed a bug that (undesirably) caused scores to be carried
#       over to the next game unless the bot was completely shutdown and
#       restarted.
#
# 0.5.9b:
#
#     * Fixed Colours to make them friendlier to light backgrounds
#     * Added '!rehash' command to restart the bot
#     * Bot now uses /notice instead of /msg for arbitrary messages. This fixes
#       a potential flood exploit and is more convenient.
#     * Help functionality added
#
# No prior Changelog available
